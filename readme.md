# Install Svelte Kit, TailwindCSS and DaisyUI in seconds

script installs all these in situ `./frontend`

## Installation

This is all that is needed. VSCode opens by default if you have it in your path. I am opinionated...

```
mkdir ~/code/project
cd ~/code/project
git clone git@github.com:proofofjogi/install-std.git
sh install.sh
```

Happy making! 
Cheers!
